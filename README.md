Compose helps with database transformations from one store to another.  It can also sync from one to another or several stores.

Transporter
===========

Build
-----
```
go build ./cmd/transporter/...
```

Adaptors
--------
* [elasticsearch](./pkg/adaptor/elasticsearch)
* [file](./pkg/adaptor/file)
* [mongodb](./pkg/adaptor/mongodb)
* [postgresql](./pkg/adaptor/postgres)
* [rethinkdb](./pkg/adaptor/rethinkdb)
* [transformer](./pkg/adaptor/transformer)

Configure
---------
There is a sample config in test/config.yaml.  The config defines the endpoints, (either sources or sinks) that are available to the application.
```yaml
api:
  interval: 60s # time interval between metrics posts to the api endpoint
  uri: "http://requestb.in/1a0zlf11"
nodes:
  localmongo:
    type: mongodb
    uri: mongodb://localhost/boom
  supernick:
    type: elasticsearch
    uri: http://10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2:9200/indexname
  debug:
    type: file
    uri: stdout://
  foofile:
    type: file
    uri: file:///tmp/foo
  stdout:
    type: file
    uri: stdout://
```

There is also a sample 'application.js' in test/application.js.  The application is responsible for building transporter pipelines.
Given the above config, this Transporter application.js will copy from a file (in /tmp/foo) to stdout.
```js
Source({name:"foofile"}).save({name:"stdout"})

```

This application.js will copy from the local mongo to a file on the local disk
```js
Source({name:"localmongo", namespace: "boom.foo"}).save({name:"tofile"})
```

Transformers can also be configured in the application.js as follows
```js
var pipeline = Source({name:"mongodb-production", namespace: "compose.milestones2"})
pipeline = pipeline.transform("transformers/transform1.js").transform("transformers/transform2.js")
pipeline.save({name:"supernick", namespace: "something/posts2"});

```
Run
---

- list `transporter list --config ./test/config.yaml`
- run `transporter run --config ./test/config.yaml ./test/application.js`
- eval `transporter eval --config ./test/config.yaml 'Source({name:"localmongo", namespace: "boom.foo"}).save({name:"tofile"})' `
- test `transporter test --config ./test/config.yaml test/application.js `

Complete beginners guide

### OS X

- follow instructions on http://golang.org/doc/install
- VERY IMPORTANT: Go has a required directory structure which the GOPATH needs to point to. Instructions can be found on http://golang.org/doc/code.html or by typing `go help gopath` in terminal.
- setup the directory structure in $GOPATH
    - `cd $GOPATH; mkdir src pkg bin`
    - create the github.com path and compose `mkdir -p src/github.com/compose; cd src/github.com/compose`
    - clone transporter `git clone https://github.com/compose/transporter; cd transporter`
    - now you can build with `go build ./cmd/transporter/...`

At this point you should be able to run transporter via `$GOPATH/bin/transporter`,  you may need to add $GOPATH to your PATH environment variable. Something along the lines of `export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"` should work.

### Vagrant

* ensure [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is installed
* ensure [ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) is installed
* ensure either [virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or [VMWare fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion) or [VMWare Workstation](http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation) is installed

```bash
> cd transporter
> vagrant up
...
> vagrant ssh
...
vagrant> ./run-test

```

### Windows
