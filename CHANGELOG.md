## v0.3.1 [2017-03-24]

### Features
- added `js` alias for `goja` transform function [#335](https://github.com/compose/transporter/pull/335) 
- `init` command will now prompt user when `pipeline.js` file already exists [#336](https://github.com/compose/transporter/pull/336)

### Bugfixes
- fixed mongodb, rabbitmq, and rethinkdb adaptors from not trying to read from a file when provided in the `ca_certs` field [#334](https://github.com/compose/transporter/pull/334)

## v0.3.0 [2017-03-21]

### Breaking changes

***PLEASE READ***

Transporter no longer requires a YAML file. All configuration is in the JS file where nodes are defined and a new DSL has been developed. Run the `init` command to see the new changes.

- if using transporter as a library, all packages have been moved out of `pkg` to the top-level
- `eval` command removed
- `list` command removed
- the `namespace` parameter now only expects a single part (the regexp filter), all adaptors have been updated to pull the "database name" from the provided URI

### Features
- NEW RabbitMQ adaptor [#298](https://github.com/compose/transporter/pull/298)
- MongoDB adaptor supports per collection query filter when needing to copy only a subset of data [#301](https://github.com/compose/transporter/pull/301)
- [goja](https://github.com/dop251/goja) added as an option for the JavaScript VM in transformers [#294](https://github.com/compose/transporter/pull/294)
- NEW [native functions](https://github.com/compose/transporter#native-functions)

### Bugfixes

## v0.2.0 [2017-02-28]

### Breaking changes
- The etcd adaptor was removed

### Features
- Integration tests are run weekly for the following pipelines:

- When being used as a library, several goroutines were leaking after the pipeline had stopped. Reported by @cognusion in [#265](https://github.com/compose/transporter/issues/265) and addressed via [#268](https://github.com/compose/transporter/pull/268) and [#280](https://github.com/compose/transporter/pull/280)

## v0.1.3 [2017-02-09]

### Breaking changes
- namespace processing no longer expects their the be a "db" portion (i.e. "database.collection")
but an attempt to maintain backwards compatibility is still there for the time being.
[#258](https://github.com/compose/transporter/pull/258)

### Bugfixes
- [#261](https://github.com/compose/transporter/pull/261): return a nil message to get skipped in the pipeline

## v0.1.2 [2017-01-27]

This release is primarily aimed at getting the MongoDB and Elasticsearch adaptors into a
stable/reliable state.

### Breaking changes
- MongoDB adaptor SSL configuration is now defined as:
```yaml
nodes:
  localmongo:
    type: mongodb
    ssl: true
    cacerts: ["/path/to/cert.pem"] # optional
```

### Bugfixes
- [#211](https://github.com/compose/transporter/pull/211): defer bulk channel init for mongo node reuse
- [#213](https://github.com/compose/transporter/pull/213): track mongodb \_id field so we can attempt to reissue queries
- [#233](https://github.com/compose/transporter/pull/233): update elasticsearch adaptor with better support
for multiple versions of elasticsearch as well as better performance with bulk indexing for most versions.
Addresses [#209](https://github.com/compose/transporter/issues/209), [#222](https://github.com/compose/transporter/issues/222),
[#167](https://github.com/compose/transporter/issues/167) and [#159](https://github.com/compose/transporter/issues/159).
- properly detect oplog access when attempting to use the `tail` option on the MongoDB adaptor.

## v0.1.1 [2015-08-27]

## v0.0.4 [2015-07-13]

This release contains several breaking changes:
- Transporter now uses [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) for vendoring depedencies.
- transformer functions now receive a document in the following format:
```
{
  "op": "insert/update/delete",
  "data": "", // what use to be passed in the doc passed to the transformer function
  "ts": 1436794521, // the number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 UTC
}
```

The same document must be returned from the function so any modifications must happen to `doc["data"]`.

***NOTE***: Deletes are now passed to the transformer functions so this needs to be accounted for.
