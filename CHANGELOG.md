stable/reliable state.

    type: mongodb
    ssl: true
    cacerts: ["/path/to/cert.pem"] # optional
```

### Bugfixes

- [#233](https://github.com/compose/transporter/pull/233): update elasticsearch adaptor with better support
for multiple versions of elasticsearch as well as better performance with bulk indexing for most versions.
Addresses [#209](https://github.com/compose/transporter/issues/209), [#222](https://github.com/compose/transporter/issues/222),
[#167](https://github.com/compose/transporter/issues/167) and [#159](https://github.com/compose/transporter/issues/159).
- properly detect oplog access when attempting to use the `tail` option on the MongoDB adaptor.

## v0.0.4 [2015-07-13]

This release contains several breaking changes:
- Transporter now uses [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) for vendoring depedencies.
- transformer functions now receive a document in the following format:
```
{
  "op": "insert/update/delete",
  "data": "", // what use to be passed in the doc passed to the transformer function
  "ts": 1436794521, // the number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 UTC
}
```

The same document must be returned from the function so any modifications must happen to `doc["data"]`.

***NOTE***: Deletes are now passed to the transformer functions so this needs to be accounted for.
